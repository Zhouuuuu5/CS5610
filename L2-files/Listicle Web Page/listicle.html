          Data Warehouse Research & Recommendations
        </div>
        <div class="description">
          A company is seeking completion of a short term data warehouse project
          vital to optimizing the way company data is stored and analyzed. The
          company currently does not have a data warehouse, which is impacting
          their ability to maintain accurate data and perform accurate and
          detailed data analysis, and therefore needs a proposal for a data
          warehouse solution. Proposal should include why selected data
          warehouse is the best solution, estimated costs for warehouse, and
          estimated time to implement, and any other implications or concerns.

          The deliverable the group of students provided enabled the company to
          select a data warehouse tool that best fit their data collection and
          storage needs. Based on proposal, subsequent student teams completed
          data visualization projects for the sponsor and created data
          dashboards using the data stored in their newly created data
          warehouse.

          A business requires a systematized approach to collection of
          structured and unstructured data and visualization of data insights
          that help organizations understand social determinants for health from
          consumer shopping perspective. The company wants to construct data
          warehouse and determine data sources. Data may not be directly
          available but when aggregated from multiple data sources, especially
          from merchant shopping behavior, the hypothesis is that insights begin
          to emerge. Currently, the company uses dummy data to build out
          econometrics model.

          Students delivered a completed data warehouse in SQL. This easy-to-use
          data analytics engine allowed the sponsor company to understand
          granular aspects of social determinants of health, including a
          recommendation engine which allowed company to recommend services for
          caregivers based on needs. Students used Tableau, R, SQL, and Python
          to complete the project. This allowed the company to aggregate their
          data more efficiently and begin to build both dashboards using Tableau
          and predictive models using Python to better visualize their data and
          see trends in customer behavior.

          Healthcare Provider Portal Data Analysis

        <div class="description">
          A start-up working to change service tracking for home healthcare
          organizations wants a twostep verification process for service time
          and task duration of care providers in order to increase provider
          efficiency and ensure patient safety. Their app utilizes a scanning
          process accessible through care providers' smartphone cameras to track
          and verify care appointment records mandated by the federal
          government.

          Students examined data stored in MySQL, cleaned and organized the data
          in a data warehouse, analyzed data for trends, and identified several
          useful correlations in data that allowed the start-up to improve the
          overall look and functionality of their healthcare portal.
